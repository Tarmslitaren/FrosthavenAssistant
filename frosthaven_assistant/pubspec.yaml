# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
# pub.dev using `flutter pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/data/
    - assets/data/editions/
    - assets/images/abilities/ #for use with monster ability card
    - assets/images/attack/ #modifier deck
    - assets/images/loot/ #loot deck
    - assets/images/class-icons/
    - assets/images/monsters/ #portraits
    - assets/images/summon/
    - assets/images/psd/
    - assets/images/bg/
    - assets/images/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    #- family: Nyala
     # fonts:
      #  - asset: assets/fonts/nyala.ttf
    #         style: italic
    - family: Majalla
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/majallab.ttf
          weight: 400 #does nothing
    - family: Pirata
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/PirataOne-Gloomhaven.ttf
    - family: GermaniaOne
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/GermaniaOne-Regular.ttf
    - family: Markazi
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/MarkaziText-VariableFont_wght.ttf
